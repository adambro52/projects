We did almost all of the work together. Usually we'd huddle around one computer and have one person type, 
but we all suggested ways to solve the problem. We all wrote our initial version of build. 
Peter and Gavin reworked this implementation to split build and execute. Additionally, we all tested the
code independently to check for inconsistent behavior and test many possible cases. Once we were satisfied
with our code, we all met together again to make the README and document the code.
